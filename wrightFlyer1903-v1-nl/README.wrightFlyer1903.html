Download the zip file and model files in the directory indicated
above.  Under linux, the files from zip archive might need to be
renamed to lower case (if they are not already that way).  Renaming to
lower case will be necessary if FlightGear crashes when trying to read
the texture files.

To use the new aircraft model and not the default Opus glider, edit the
wrightFlyer1903-v1-nl-uiuc-set.xml file and change the string:

"Aircraft/UIUC/Models/opus/opus-model.xml"

to 

"Aircraft/wrightFlyer1903/Models/uiuc/03Flyer/03Flyer-model.xml"

after the model files have been installed.

Model description and updates:

5/26/02 - First release: v1-nl

* This model is based partly on wind tunnel tests of a 1903 Wright
  Flyer replica tested at NASA Ames by a group lead by Prof Culick at
  Caltech.  The model is a nonlinear model, meaning that stall is
  included.  Because the replica was not tested to stall, data in this
  regime had to be deduced from a number of different sources,
  including low Reynolds number airfoil data taken at UIUC.

* Wonder what it was like to fly the 1903 Wright Flyer?  Be a test
  pilot.  See the longitudinal static instability.  Fly steady,
  straight and level using some trim to help relieve pressure on the
  stick, then put in a brief canard pulse (elevator stick) so as not
  to change the trim speed.  With an up canard pulse and hands off the
  stick, the Wright Flyer will start to pitch upwards until it
  stalls. Down pulse, and it goes down.  This same instability is seen
  by simply trying to fly straight and level!  The rates are low
  enough that a good pilot with practice can stay ahead of the static
  instability.  Stall can get pretty nasty if both the canard and
  biplane wing stall at the same time. Typically, however, only the
  canard will stall first.  Full up elevator can be used to fly out of
  the dive.  But in this condition the canard is stalled. Relieving
  the back pressure will move the canard out of stall and the pull-out
  will be a little bit faster, but the difference is hard to notice.
  Keep in mind that this aircraft was flown four times before it was
  damaged on Dec 17, 1903.  The first flight was 120 feet in 12
  seconds, and the last was 852 feet in 59 seconds.  How far can you
  fly?

* Run with the FGFS "enable-auto-coordination" option (see run command
  at the top of this file) to model the coupling between the wing
  warping and rudder to counteract the adverse yaw effect of the wing
  warping.  The amount of coupling has been tuned to match that on the
  original Wright Flyer.  The resulting handling is not that great.
  For later designs, the Wright Brothers decoupled the warping and
  rudder to have more control and the ability to fly in coordinated
  flight ("cross-controls").

* Finally, it's a hand full!
